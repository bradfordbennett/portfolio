In August 2009, I performed as one of 200 guitarists in Rhys Chatham's *A Crimson Grail* at Lincoln Center's Damrosch Park, New York City.

The piece — an antiphonal work for 200 electric guitars, 16 electric basses, and percussion — was originally composed for 400 guitars and premiered at the Sacré-Cœur basilica in Paris in 2005. The Lincoln Center performance was a complete reworking commissioned for the outdoor summer festival.

An estimated 10,000 people attended. The performance was recorded and released on Nonesuch Records.
