*Fiji Dance / Fiji Bus* was a sound art installation at the Inaugural exhibition, Ellipsis Gallery, Woolloomooloo.

The work speaks to the erosion of memory, employing recordings of my partner's voice while on holiday in Fiji. The tape is inexorably dragged across the upturned blade of a Stanley knife during the course of the show — slowly destroying itself.

The piece provided the ambient soundtrack for the opening night, and by the end of the exhibition, nothing remained.

**Exhibition:** Inaugural at Ellipsis Gallery, Sydney (2022)
