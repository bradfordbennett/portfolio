In 1987 Tom Waits released *Frank's Wild Years*, a concept album that is part decrepit carnival, part journal entries from an exotic odyssey. The record was also a play, or maybe an opera. Either way, it opens with a fantastic, crazy, silly celebration of grease, gasoline and speed.

These small format photographs were taken with a FujiFilm Instax, inspired by the lyrics to "Hang on St. Christopher". They were exhibited as part of *Photos Inspired by Song Lyrics* at Head On Photo Festival, Sydney in 2015.
