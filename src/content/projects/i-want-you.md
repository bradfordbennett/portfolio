You could call it erotica.

A series of acrylic prints made from photographs I've taken with a plastic lens film camera, handbound into a large book. Embracing pure desire seems to be out of sync with contemporary art movements — which is precisely why it felt necessary.

**Medium:** Acrylic on handmade cotton rag, handbound and boxed with various papers  
**Dimensions:** 320mm × 220mm closed

**Exhibition:** 2025... at Ellipsis Gallery, Sydney
