<div style="margin: 2rem 0;">

In Borges' classic story *Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius*, the narrator discovers a single volume — the eleventh — of *A First Encyclopaedia of Tlön*. The volume covers entries Hlaer to Jangr, describing the geography, languages, philosophy, and culture of an entirely imaginary world.

I wrote this missing book.

Complete with illustrations, the encyclopaedia was handbound into an edition of two copies. One was given to Sarah Kinkel for her birthday. The other was traded to Mark Wotherspoon for a painting.
