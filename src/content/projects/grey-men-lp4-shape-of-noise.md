The fourth full-length from The Grey Men, released on Inner Demons Records.

The Grey Men are a Sydney-based drone/doom duo exploring the outer limits of volume, texture, and endurance. Inspired by Earth, Sunn O))), and the raw physicality of sound, we use guitars, modular synthesizers, and field recordings to create music that's both harsh and transcendent.
