A 2013 Moto Guzzi V7, transformed into a blacked out cafe racer through years of iterative modification. Built for both solo commutes through Sydney and spirited weekend rides with a pillion.

## The Fairing

The centrepiece is a hand-laid fiberglass fairing cast from a vintage 1970s Kawasaki H1R mold by Brian Crane, a retired fiberglasser whose shed is filled with Cobra car bodies, boats, and motorcycle molds dating back to the Australian cult film *Stone*. Custom brackets were CNC-machined by Darren at DNA Customs to fit the Guzzi's wider engine heads, with an off-centre mounted R1 headlamp.

## Philosophy

"There is no name for this build. Often if you caress a bike enough, tickle its nuts, it whispers you its name. This Guzzi is my daily rider. Sometimes I love it. Sometimes it pisses me off."

The best thing about modern bikes: you don't need a ton of engine work to make them rad. Just improve airflow and fuel mix, then sort the handling and looks.
