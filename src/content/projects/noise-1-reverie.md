Two pieces created for *AI Review*, a group show at Ellipsis Gallery, Woolloomooloo.

<div style="margin: 2rem 0;">

## Noise 1

A handbound artist book created with The Grey Men. The imagery explores the inappropriate use of AI to generate visual noise — pushing the tools toward abstraction and error rather than fidelity.

## Reverie

The Grey Men's LP2, released on limited edition cassette for the exhibition. The music itself was created using AI in deliberately "wrong" ways — treating the technology as a noise generator rather than a creative collaborator.

</div>

Both pieces question what happens when you refuse to use AI "properly."
