Bling Kong was an 11-piece rock band from New York City: four cheerleaders, three drummers, two guitarists, one bassist, and a "video ninja."

We released *Do The Awesome* on Redder Records in 2005. SPIN Magazine wrote us up as "reform school cheerleaders backed by guys with an equal love for the Runaways, Electric Six, and penis humor."

The band was known for chaotic live shows and an aesthetic that blurred the line between rock concert and performance art.
