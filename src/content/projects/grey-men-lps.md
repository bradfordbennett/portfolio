The Grey Men are a Sydney-based drone/doom duo exploring the outer limits of volume, texture, and endurance.

## Albums

- **The Shape of Noise to Come** (2024) — Inner Demons Records
- **Wealth** (2024)
- **Reverie** (2023)
- **Cascade** (2022)

Inspired by Earth, Sunn O))), and the raw physicality of sound, we use guitars, modular synthesizers, and field recordings to create music that's both harsh and transcendent.
